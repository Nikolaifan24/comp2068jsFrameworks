                    A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal baths. Spa towns
                    or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health treatments, which are also known as
                    balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to prehistoric times. Such practices have
                    been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in Europe and Japan. Day spas are also quite popular, and offer
                    various personal care treatments.

                        The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times, when
                        the location was called Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere meaning to
                        scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that the word "spa"
                        originated from the name of the Belgian town named Spa where a curative natural spring was discovered in the 14th
                        century.

                        In the modern world spa therapies are linked to various domains including beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health.
                        Spa industry is thought to be growing at a significantly high rate, and most importantly it is observed to embrace
                        wellness as its core business. By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the
                        United States
